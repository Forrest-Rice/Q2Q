# i18n

This directory is to serve your locale translation files. YAML under this folder would be loaded automatically and register with their filenames as locale code.

Check out [`vue-i18n`](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next) for more details.

If you are using VS Code, [`i18n Ally`](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally) is recommended to make the i18n experience better.
